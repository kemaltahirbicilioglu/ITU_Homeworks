# Algorithms 1 â€“ Homework Repository (2024-2025)

This repository contains the code implementations and reports for the **2024-2025 Algorithms 1** course assignments.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use

- Each assignment is organized into separate folders.
- Inside each folder, you will find:
  - **Report:** A detailed explanation of the assignment and the analyses.
  - **Code:** The implementation of the assignment. (I did not delete the csv files, so you can check the implementations by yourself)
