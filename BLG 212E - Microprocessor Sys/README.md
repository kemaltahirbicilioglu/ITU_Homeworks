### Project 1: Iterative and Recursive Knapsack in Assembly

In this project, we were tasked with implementing the **iterative** and **recursive** versions of the **Knapsack algorithm** in assembly language.  
- While the iterative solution is relatively **straightforward**, the recursive version can be challenging.  
- It is recommended to first practice with simpler recursive algorithms that have fewer branching cases before tackling the Knapsack problem.  

### Project 2: Pointer Swapping Bubble Sort in C and Assembly

This project involved creating a **compact program** combining **C** and **assembly files**, allowing function calls between the two languages.  
- The goal was to implement **Bubble Sort** by **swapping pointers** rather than the actual values.  
  - Unlike the standard Bubble Sort, the emphasis here is on **pointer swapping**.  
- Detailed explanations and example images can be found in the report under the **Sorting Algorithm** section within the project folder.  
- Additionally, we compared the execution time of our Bubble Sort with a given **Merge Sort** using the **SysTick timer**.
