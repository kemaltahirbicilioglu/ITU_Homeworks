# Data Structures – Homework Repository (2023-2024)

This repository contains the code implementations and assignment descriptions for the **2023-2024 Data Structures** course.

## 📌 How to Use

- Each assignment is organized into separate folders.
- Inside each folder, you will find:
  - **Assignment Description:** The details of the assignment.
  - **Code:** The implementation of the assignment.

## 📝 About Homework 5

In Homework 5, we were required to compare all the data structures we previously implemented, grouped into specific categories.  

📂 **Overview:**  
- **`cpp files for testing/`** → Contains the groups used for comparison.  
- **`generate.cpp`** → Generates the necessary test data and operation files.  
- **`exe.py`** → Compiles all the C++ files.  
- **`parser.py`** → Runs the groups and generates graphs based on the results.  

⚠ **Note:**  
- Testing can be time-consuming when working with large datasets.  
- When the datasets are small, most operations run in **O(log n)** time, making the execution too fast for meaningful comparisons.  
- For accurate testing, large datasets should be used, as discussed in my report.
